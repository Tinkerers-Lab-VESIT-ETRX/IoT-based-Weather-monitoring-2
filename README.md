Weather plays a crucial role in human life. Weather monitoring is necessary, in order to maintain good crop growth, to ensure safe working conditions of workers in industries and mines, to ensure good health conditions, etc. Due to unprecedented growth of industries and vehicular traffic, the purity of clean air and environment, is severely affected. So, to monitor and evaluate, the circumstances in case of exceeding the prescribed level of parameters, an effective environmental monitoring system is needed.

The Weather Stations have to own Data Centre to access and send the information, these data centres are expensive to build and maintain. The satellite weather report system is currently not capable of giving the exact weather condition report for a particular area. So, in order to monitor the weather conditions of a particular place, IoT based approach taken. 

To design a Weather monitoring system, using various sensors and microcontroller (Arduino UNO), on proteus software. From the microcontroller, the data from all sensors, is uploaded to the Firebase, which is central database. For the end consumer, a web app is to be designed, which retrieve the data from Firebase and display the readings in a graphical format.
